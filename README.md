Hink
====

### Purpose
An API containing all of your text or file
based data.  Hink tries to make it easy to store notes, links, images via RESTful API.

### Goal
This project is frontend agnostic, so anything that consumes this api will be up
to you or included in a different repository.

### Deploy

### The CLI
There is a cli script (`./bin/cli`). It allows you to do one-off queries from
the command line, or interactively prod your database. The interactive
functionality is provided given the -i or --interactive flag.

__Hink means "bucket" in Swedish__
