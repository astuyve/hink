# We dont define schemas in the traditional sense
# since we generate the controllers via a controller template (textController,
# fileController, etc)
#
# This simply provides an outline of the data to be stored.
# @searchable - searchable content keys. Since these can differ by the type of
#   data youre storing. (ex. task data might have a date_due searchable key)
# @type - This simply determines which controller generates the routes.
#    type:
#      text -> textController
#      file -> fileController
